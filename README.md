# GitHub-profile-finder
My version of Brad Traversy's GitHub Finder app (from his Modern JS course).

To test the App you have to put your own GitHub ID and Key in the `github.ts` file, otherwise the network requests won't work.

You can create an OAuth app via the following link : https://github.com/settings/applications/new
